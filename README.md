As a courious person I wanted to try some basic Solidity smart contract using Remix IDE

A very simple HTML front end with buttons that can interact with smart contract functions as setting your mood and getting your mood

What I learned:
- How to Create a basic Solidity smart contract
and connect the web page using Ethers.js.
- I tested this with Ropsten, Rinkeby, GoErli
